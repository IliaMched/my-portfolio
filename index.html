        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I recently started a clothing brand that is getting some traction and my goal after this class is to be able to make a functioning mobile/desktop version of the website coded from scratch as I currently use Squarespace with some extra code I added to it.
 
</p>
		<p>
		I've previously been an intern at a digital marketing Agency as a front-end web developer and learned lots of HTML and JS tricks to make optimized HTML email forms and pages for every major device out there. I personally made HTML emails for CIBC, BMW, Johnson & Johnson and other companies as well. It was a while ago so my coding is rusty.
